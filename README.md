# Uni_work-Embedded_system_in_c
This project implements embedded control algorithms for robotics applications using the C programming language on the MSP432 microcontroller platform. The focus is on communication with sensors and actuators, motor control via UART in half-duplex mode, and implementing basic movement states such as straight driving, wall following, and rotation.
